# Report #

By Jakub Hampl (s0802690)

I am in a group with Jack Yun Ying (s0806931). However we worked independently and ended up with very different version of the application sharing very little code. We decided together to each submit separately. Therefore I would like to have a separate mark. Following is a rather detailed account of how this happened and the distribution of the work.

The current project uses the following code written by Jack:

- in `SplashScreen.java` lines 60 & 62
- parts of the method `save` in `ImagePanel.java` are loosely based on Jack's code.

To complete the credits: the whole project is based on Michal's sample code. The file `SplashScreen.java` is based on a tutorial provided by Oracle. The design and report are completely my own work.


The reason we have 2 submissions (at least as seen from my point of view) is
that Jack wrote a separate application without telling me (until 12 hours before the deadline). He was doing this and
without using my code that he had access to (the code is in a GitHub in a repository he had access to as confirmed by an email). I was quite surprised to
see he had a fully working application quite distinct in style and
design from what I had written. Since there was little in common merging the code would be very time consuming and would make little sense since the design behind each was quite different.

He has also written me an email messages apologizing for not having done much:

>  ...Also, I would do more (like read the label file and load review the image labels) tonight if I got time, sorry about that I got English test soon so I did not put much effort on it...

(2 days before deadline)

I assumed that meant the almost nonexistent commits to our
repository (the only which was a tiny snippet on which I based my save function). As an uneven mark split was possible that was something I
considered to negotiate about at that point, but since he has without my knowledge
created his own application the situation has become more complicated.

I have the GitHub repository set to private, but I can grant access to it to see commit logs if necessary. 

Thus I would like to be marked preferably separately, if not possible then I would like a 90% split.
